    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound Pure Farmland® Plant-Based Homestyle Meatballs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup grape tomatoes (10-12 tomatoes)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt, divided</li>
        <li>2 large green zucchini, spiralized (about 1.5 lbs, before spiralized)</li>
        <li>⅓ cup prepared basil pesto</li>
        <li>¼ cup roasted almonds, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Grated Parmesan cheese for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, then the meatballs. Cook, turning frequently, until even golden brown and heated through the center, 8 to 10 minutes total. Remove from skillet to a paper towel-lined plate. Once skillet is cool enough to handle, wipe clean with paper towel.</li>
        <li>Return skillet to medium heat. Add 1 teaspoon olive oil, tomatoes, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until slightly golden and just tender (but not burst). Remove to a plate.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil, then zucchini noodles. Season with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and stir very gently to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes or until zoodles are slightly tender. Add the pesto and stir gently to combine.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a large serving platter and top with meatballs, tomatoes, roasted almonds, and Parmesan cheese, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
        <li>And voila! Our finger-licking delicious zoodles are ready! Enjoy!</li>
