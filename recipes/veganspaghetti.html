    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice tomatoes and return them to the can with their juice.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic to the hot oil and saute, stirring frequently, for 2 minutes. Stir in diced tomatoes and their juice, tomato sauce, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well blended. Bring sauce to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Let simmer while preparing meatballs.</li>
        <li>Combine beef substitute with bread crumbs, parsley, remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt, remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder in a bowl; mix until ingredients are well combined. Roll the mixture into twelve 1 1/2-inch balls.
        </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add meatballs to the pan and saute, turning occasionally, until all sides are browned and a bit crisp, about 10 minutes total. Reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Pour simmering tomato sauce over the meatballs and mix. Simmer sauce with meatballs for an additional 10 minutes. Serve meatballs and sauce over spaghetti.
